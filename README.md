#brickbybrick

The "BrickByBrick" platform aims to address the challenges faced by workers and businesses in the construction sector, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. 
For workers, the platform provides easy access to job opportunities and ensures transparency in payments and work schedules. 
For businesses, it streamlines the process of finding skilled laborers quickly and efficiently. 
Supervisors serve as intermediaries, ensuring smooth communication and operations.
The ultimate goal is to reduce unemployment, bridge the rural-urban employment gap, and foster economic growth through technology-driven solutions.

The platform is designed to cater to three primary user groups: workers, businesses, and supervisors. Its functionality includes:

1. Worker Interface: Facilitates job browsing, applications, and registration with user-friendly search and filter options.
2. Business Interface: Enables businesses to post job requirements, track project progress, and manage workers effectively.
3. Supervisor Interface: Provides tools for monitoring work progress, addressing worker queries, and maintaining communication with businesses.
